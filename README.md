# 3D Modelling and WebGL Final Project by Temirlan Baibolov

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Start the project with usual `npm start`.

## Models

I downloaded all models from the internet. But for the house I separated the garage door and garage window from other meshes (thet were joined in the initial model) and changed a pivot point and added a small red button on the side of garage door.
The models were also very strangely scaled, so I just changed it from the code. 
For the car model all 4 tires were separated, I wanted to join them to make it a bit lighter but I kept getting a messed up model on gltf.pmnd.rs so I left it as it is.
For some reason all trees are ~200kb which was quite unexpected for me. I tried applying some basic compression methods on them, but it did not help much (reduced like only ~50kb at most).

## Trees

I randomly generate tree positions and types using lodash random. But the problem was that trees kept spawning near the house or they would collide with each other so I had to take my time and make sure it is generated properly.

## Lighting

I initially wanted sun and moon spin around to simulate a whole day, but it looked quite ugly and I did not figure out how to make a sky blue in the day and black in the night.
So I just left the night and used a Stars component from drei.

The moon was also supposed to be visible, but I failed to make it look nice so it is only a direction light.

For some strange reason trees did not cast their shadows on the ground. At the end I found a solution with shadowMapFar, shadowMapLeft, ... properties from the internet which just magically worked. I honestly dont really understand what it does right now...

## Interactions

I wanted to have a nice custom interface which shows all information about the currently selected object. 
I kinda managed to get it done, but it is very ugly and not really scalable. 
I also discovered a React bug "context declared outside canvas cannot be accessed from within the canvas" and the solution I found was a ForwardCanvas component.
And every context change was rerendering the whole canvas so I had to put it in a `memo`. 
Also the garage door animation and car move animation are done in a very very stupid way with `useInterval` since I could not figure out anything better at the moment. 

## Parallax

I wanted both a parallax effect and an ability to rotate the camera, so I ended up not using lerp.

## What I wanted to add but did not

I saw a lot of great looking examples of a sky+sun which use the Sky component from drei. I got the general idea of using elevation and azimuth but integrating it just felt too complex and time consuming so I decided against it. 

The car animation was supposed to allow the user to actually control the car, but the way I implemented interactions was so ugly that it would have taken ages to implement.
